# HOWTO find the run4theh111z server

**Or how to join the faction hinted at in 19dfj3l1nd.msg**

When you get invited to hack the run4theh111z server (I fucking hate 1337. l33t is teh suck!) you won't be able to find it with scan-analyze from home. The server is deeper than 10 levels, so you will have to find it another
way.

Interestingly enough I noticed that I was running a scripts on run4theh111z when I got the invite. The script that launched the scripts used a depth first approach to find all usable servers to run scripts on, and I found it that way. So I modified that script to find the path to any server that is connected in some way to home. I called the script findhost.js.

```
[home ~/]> run findhost.js run4theh111z
Running script with 1 thread(s), pid 71 and args: ["run4theh111z"].
findhost.js: home->n00dles->zer0->omega-net->comptek->zb-institute->millenium-fitness->snap-fitness->unitalife->zeus-med->nova-med->run4theh111z
```

It prints out the chain you have to follow to get to the host. 

If you go there you can find the following lit:
```
The New God

Everyone has a moment in their life when they wonder about the bigger questions.

What's the point of all this? What is my purpose?

Some people dare to think even bigger.

What will the fate of the human race be?

We live in an era vastly different from that of 15 or even 20 years ago. We have gone beyond the limits of humanity. We have stripped ourselves of the tyranny of flesh.

The Singularity is here. The merging of man and machine. This is where humanity evolves into something greater. This is our future.

Embrace it, and you will obey a new god. The God in the Machine.
```

This is the first mention of the Singularity, proper noun.
