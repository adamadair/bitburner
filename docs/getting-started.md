# Getting Started

Soon after starting the game you get contacted by someone named jump3R telling you they 
can help but only once your ready, and then you receive a program called fl1ght.exe to
help track progress. The amount of elite-speak in this game is fucking nausiating.

So the inital goal is to get:
- Install 30 Augmentations
- Get $100b
- Raise hacking skill to 2500

The miletstones for achieving this are:
- Gain root access on CSEC
- Install the backdoor on CSEC
- Join the faction hinted at in csec-test.msg
- Install all the Augmentations from CyberSec
- Join the faction hinted at in nitesec-test.msg
- Install all the Augmentations from NiteSec
- Join the faction hinted at in j3.msg
- Install all the Augmentations from The Black Hand
- Join the faction hinted at in 19dfj3l1nd.msg
- Install all the Augmentations from BitRunners

Some things I dicovered that help are:
- Get all the Tian Di Hui augmentations as early as possible, because it helps with getting faction rep, which takes longer and longer the further you get into the game. You can travel to New Tokyo to get the invite.
