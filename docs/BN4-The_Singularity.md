# HOWTO complete BN4 

Most methods of making money are completely nerfed in this bitnode. You will not get
far if you try to rely on hacking or the hacknet to make cash, but this is obvious
as soon as you get into it. As with the other bitnodes, they are trying to steer you
towards a different way to solve the same problem, but in this case it might not be 
obvious as they leave no clues at all as to the best way to get started. After poking around
a bit I figured out a path to completion and finished it in a little over 2 days. I think
I could do it faster a second time now that I know what I am doing. Here is the basic plan:

1. Level up hacking enough to run infinity-remote-spinup.js to get the easy servers making money. You need $11m.

2. Get the first RAM upgrade on your home computer and then run grow-bad-karma.js. You need to get to 18K kills, and 
this will take a while, about 15 hours or so. This is really boring, but this is using the singularity 
functions as advertised. Once you grow sufficient bad karma you can start a gang.

3. Create your gang with the slum snakes, or any other combat gang.

4. run manage-combat-gang.js, and let it level up your gang until you get 100%

5. Once you get $31b, buy everything you need for stock market trading. Run be-the-wolf.js.

6. Once you get $150b start your corpporation, and follow the bn3 notes to make a shit ton of money.

7. Once you have a steady gang and corporation income, buy every hacking related augmentation from your gang and 
finish the bitnode. Don't be afraid to install augmentations often, your gang and corp will make it up quickly. 
I think I installed 5 or 6 times before completing the bitnode
