The Complete Handbook for Creating a Successful Corporation

Getting Started with Corporations
To get started, visit the City Hall in Sector-12 in order to create a Corporation. This requires $150b of your own money, but this $150b will get put into your Corporation's funds. Your Corporation can have many different divisions, each in a different Industry. There are many different types of Industries, each with different properties. To create your first division, click the 'Expand into new Industry' button at the top of the management UI. The Agriculture and Software industries are recommended for your first division.

The first thing you'll need to do is hire some employees. Employees can be assigned to five different positions. Each position has a different effect on various aspects of your Corporation. It is recommended to have at least one employee at each position.

Each industry uses some combination of Materials in order to produce other Materials and/or create Products. Specific information about this is displayed in each of your divisions' UI.

Products are special, industry-specific objects. They are different than Materials because you must manually choose to develop them, and you can choose to develop any number of Products. Developing a Product takes time, but a Product typically generates significantly more revenue than any Material. Not all industries allow you to create Products. To create a Product, look for a button in the top-left panel of the division UI (e.g. For the Software Industry, the button says 'Develop Software').

To get your supply chain system started, purchase the Materials that your industry needs to produce other Materials/Products. This can be done by clicking the 'Buy' button next to the corresponding Material(s). After you have the required Materials, you will immediately start production. The amount of Materials/Products you produce is based on a variety of factors, one of which is your employees and their productivity.

Once you start producing Materials/Products, you can sell them in order to start earning revenue. This can be done by clicking the 'Sell' button next to the corresponding Material or Product. The amount of Material/Product you sell is dependent on a wide variety of different factors.

These are the basics of getting your Corporation up and running! Now, you can start purchasing upgrades to improve your bottom line. If you need money, consider looking for seed investors, who will give you money in exchange for stock shares. Otherwise, once you feel you are ready, take your Corporation public! Once your Corporation goes public, you can no longer find investors. Instead, your Corporation will be publicly traded and its stock price will change based on how well it's performing financially. You can then sell your stock shares in order to make money.

Tips/Pointers
-The 'Smart Supply' upgrade is extremely useful. Consider purchasing it as soon as possible.

-Purchasing Hardware, Robots, AI Cores, and Real Estate can potentially increase your production. The effects of these depend on what industry you are in.

-In order to optimize your production, you will need a good balance of Operators, Managers, and Engineers

-Different employees excel in different jobs. For example, the highly intelligent employees will probably do best if they are assigned to do Engineering work or Research & Development.

-If your employees have low morale, energy, or happiness, their production will greatly suffer.

-Tech is important, but don't neglect sales! Having several Businessmen can boost your sales and your bottom line.

-Don't forget to advertise your company. You won't have any business if nobody knows you.

-Having company awareness is great, but what's really important is your company's popularity. Try to keep your popularity as high as possible to see the biggest benefit for your sales

-Remember, you need to spend money to make money!

-Corporations do not reset when installing Augmentations, but they do reset when destroying a BitNode

## Strategy
### Stage 1. Getting initial capital.
The first goal is getting a temporary profit as much as possible for at least ~30 seconds.

1. Start with some cheap division with products. I prefer Software but this may work with other divisions.

2. Expand it to all cities and increase all offices to 6 people. IMPORTANT: Do not spend money to any upgrades at this point (except maybe Smart Storage).

3. Put 2 workers to Operations, Engineers and R&D

4. Spend all rest money to Warehouse upgrades in all cities. First two cities should have the biggest Warehouse, next two smaller and the last two even more smaller.

5. Now set the price to MP for your material in all cities (AI Cores in case of Software division) but keep amount to zero. So you won't really sell any materials at this point.

6. Start buying some supply materials. You don't have Smart Supply at this point so you need to figure out the amount of materials by yourself but it shouldn't be 100% effective. Just make sure you don't accumulate supply materials in warehouses.

7. Now wait until you get all your warehouses full of production material.

8. Move all workers to Business. And if you still have some money then you can spend it on coffee and parties for workers.

9. At this step you need to do everything very fast:
    - Go to the first city with biggest Warehouse and start selling MAX materials
    - Then do the same in other cities starting from bigger Warehouse to smaller ones.
    - When all cities start selling materials go to Corporation tab and press Find Investors a few times (1-3). Remember, you have to do that before you sold all your materials! (usually it's about 30 seconds)

If you did everything right you'll get about $5t - $25t. Don't worry about lost Shares, it doesn't really matter. Even if you'll have just 1% of them you'll still be able to get ridiculously big amount of money.

### Journey to profitability

The goal to spend the money wisely to get a stable profit and Market-TA II research ASAP.

1. At first spend most your money on Wilson Analytics (it should be about 15-17 lvl), keep about $2t. Believe me it worth it.

2. Expand one office to 70-100 employees and distribute them more or less evenly between all positions except Training.

3. Start developing the first product with $1b/$1b budget (or more if you get a lot of money at stage 1) in the biggest city.

4. Spend all rest money on AdVert. Inc. At this point even without a product you should be getting a few millions per sec.

5. Spend all income on developing other cities and buying upgrades.

6. Once you get 5000 Research Points buy the first research.

7. Once the product will be ready sell it at maximum possible price. You can figure out the best price experimentally: just set it to MP*10 and gradually decrease it until you start sell the same amount you produce. It's usually about MP*5 - MP*8. Do the same with other products.

8. While you wait 70000 RP (for Market-TA II) develop new products, buy upgrades, develop other cities, buy hardware, etc. Time to time discontinue old products and develop new ones with bigger budget ($10b, $100b, $1t, etc)

So at this stage you should be earning about $30m - $70m / sec and good amount of research points. Don't waste research point to any upgrades, Market-TA II is the only upgrade you really need to earn all the money :)

Once you get 70000 RP buy Market-TA II and enable it for all materials and products. After that you can spend all your money on AdVert. Inc and see how it adds zeros to your profit.

You can go public now and issue some dividends.

### Stage 3. Getting all the money.
Now you have a really good profit to freely open new divisions and develop your corp really fast. But it's still not enough to get all the money. The problem is AdVert. Inc is become too expensive. Besides your division probably is not the most profitable. So the solution is using all your resources to create a new division and make it the best.

1. Choose new division. I prefer Robotics. Expand it to all cities.

2. Expand offices to 150 (or more) employees in all cities and put all of them to R&D. You'll need Market-TA II here too. RP should be earned much faster this time. Don't buy AdVert Inc. yet!

3. While waiting buy as much Warehouses as possible in all cities.

4. Then start fill it with materials which increase the production multiplier. For Robotics that's mostly Hardware, AI Cores, Real Estate. Better quality of material gives you more multiplier, so you may want to open new divisions just to create new high quality materials and export it to the main division. I usually get about 500 Production Multiplier from that but it can be bigger.

5. Once you get Market-TA II distribute all employees to all positions except Training.

6. Then start develop new products. Use all possible budget you have. Probably it worth to accumulate some money to spend even better budget on it.

7. Once you develop all 3 (or 4 with Capacity I) products it start bring you trillions per sec. But don't buy AdVert Inc. yet!

8. Now it's time to upgrade Wilson Analytics as much as possible. About 40-45 lvl. It should be easy with your current profit.

9. Once you get this level start pressing AdVert Inc. and looking how fast the suffix in your profit become Q, then S , then it start show you profit in scientific notation.

10. If suddenly you don't have enough money to buy next AdVert Inc., then just go to your corp tab, buy a bunch Wilson Analytics upgrades (probably with other upgrades), and continue press AdVert Inc. until... you get as much money as you want :)
