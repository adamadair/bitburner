# BN12 - Strategy Notes
The BN12 Challenge is to detstroy the bitnode 50 times, which is about 30 times more
than I have completes all the other bitnodes combined. The challenge is obviously to 
automate the destruction of the bitnode. 

I already have scripts that manage combat gangs and can complete the bladeburner 
black ops missions, so the strategy will be to use gangs for income and augmentations
and work towards a bladeburner victory.

## Phase I: Initial Setup
The bitnode starts with a one working hacknet node, and 256 GB of RAM. The objective is
in this phase is to create a gang, join the blade burner division, and have all sleeves
recovered from shock. We will also need at least 1TB of home RAM to run all of our scripts.

1) Clear the cache and reset stored variables.
2) Sell hashes on a loop.
3) Set sleeves to working out all 4 combat skills
4) Set main to working out at powergym to increase each combat skill to 100
5) Join the blade burner division
6) Set all sleeves to comitting homicide
7) Set main to committing homicide
8) When at -54000 karma create the gang. 
9) Start bladeburner script
10) Start gang management script.
11) At $500m buy tor, and all the darkweb programs.
12) Purchase RAM upgrade
13) Start stock management script.
14) Start the remote hacking scripts, and fucking joes guns
15) Install augmentations and start phase II when the following is true:
    - Purchased The Blade's Simulacrum $150b
    - Purchased EsperTech Bladeburner Eyewear
    - EMS-4 Recombination
    - All sleeves have recovered from shock
    - Home has been upgraded to 1.02 TB RAM
    - All stock exchange upgrades are purchased.

## Phase II: Level up main
In this phase we focus on purchasing all the bladburner augmentations for main, upgrading our
sleeves with the easily attainable augmentations, 

## Phase III: Go for the Kill
