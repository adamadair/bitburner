# HOWTO: BN5

Like BN4 the money you get from hacking is significantly reduced, and worse yet so are corporations.
This bitnode forces you into criminal activity and inflitration to make money, but you still need
to level up hacking at the same time. Where as you could focus on only the hacking augmentations in
previous bitnodes, this one requires you to take a more balanced approach to augmentation purchases.
This is made even more difficult by the fact that augemntations cost more and the per purchase
multiplier is increased so it is harder to queue up a large number of augmentation for each install.

The strategy is similar to BN4:

1. Level up hacking enough to run infinity-remote-spinup.js to get the easy servers making money. You need $11m.

2. Get the first RAM upgrade on your home computer and then run grow-bad-karma.js. You need to get to 18K kills, and 
this will take a while, about 15 hours or so. This is really boring, but this is using the singularity 
functions as advertised. Once you grow sufficient bad karma you can start a gang.

3. Create your gang with the slum snakes, or any other combat gang.

4. run manage-combat-gang.js, and let it level up your gang until you get 100% territory.

5. Once you get $31b, buy everything you need for stock market trading. Run be-the-wolf.js. 

6. Once you get $150b start your corpporation, and follow the bn3 notes to make a shit ton of money.

7. Once you have a steady gang and corporation income, buy every hacking related augmentation from your gang and 
finish the bitnode. Don't be afraid to install augmentations often, your gang and corp will make it up quickly. 
I think I installed 5 or 6 times before completing the bitnode

# Purchase Order of Augmentations
